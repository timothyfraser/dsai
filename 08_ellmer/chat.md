That’s a sharp instinct — ellmer is perfect for teaching practical LLM workflows in R without burying students in Pythonic complexity. You’re right: it lacks LangChain’s compositional “graph-of-agents” structure, but you can fake it cleanly in R with functions, lists, and pipelines.

Let’s sketch a minimal, teachable framework for multi-agent workflows with ellmer, leveraging R’s functional style.


---

🎯 Goal

Teach students how to:

1. Define lightweight “agents” as R functions wrapping ellmer calls.


2. Chain or branch these agents in a “graph” — i.e., structured list or tibble of interactions.


3. Pass structured results (e.g., JSON or R lists) between agents.




---

🧩 Step 1. Define minimal agent abstraction

Each agent is just a function taking a message (and optional context), calling an ellmer model, and returning structured output.

library(ellmer)

agent = function(name, system_prompt, model = "gpt-4-turbo") {
  function(input) {
    message = paste(system_prompt, "\n\nUser:", input)
    response = complete(
      model = model,
      prompt = message,
      temperature = 0.2
    )
    list(agent = name, input = input, output = response)
  }
}


---

🧠 Step 2. Create simple agents

planner = agent("planner", "You are a task planner. Break down the user's goal into small tasks.")
researcher = agent("researcher", "You are a researcher who finds background info.")
writer = agent("writer", "You are a writer who summarizes results clearly.")


---

🔄 Step 3. Define a “workflow graph”

Represent the workflow as a list of agents and rules for data flow.

Simplest pattern: sequential pipeline.

workflow = list(planner, researcher, writer)

run_workflow = function(workflow, input) {
  output = input
  for (agent in workflow) {
    res = agent(output)
    cat("\n---", res$agent, "---\n", res$output, "\n")
    output = res$output
  }
  invisible(output)
}

Now run:

run_workflow(workflow, "Write a short report about the future of solar energy.")


---

🪄 Step 4. (Optional) Directed “agent graph”

To mimic a multi-agent graph (not just a chain), you can define edges explicitly:

graph = tibble::tibble(
  from = c("planner", "planner", "researcher"),
  to   = c("researcher", "writer", "writer")
)

agents = list(planner = planner, researcher = researcher, writer = writer)

run_graph = function(graph, agents, start, input) {
  queue = list(list(name = start, input = input))
  visited = list()
  
  while (length(queue) > 0) {
    node = queue[[1]]
    queue = queue[-1]
    
    res = agents[[node$name]](node$input)
    visited[[node$name]] = res
    
    next_nodes = graph$to[graph$from == node$name]
    for (n in next_nodes) {
      queue = append(queue, list(list(name = n, input = res$output)))
    }
  }
  visited
}

Then call:

results = run_graph(graph, agents, "planner", "Create a one-pager on AI for disaster response.")


---

💬 Step 5. Introduce Function Calling (for structured outputs)

Teach students to use ellmer’s function calling for explicit data transfer between agents:

task_parser = agent(
  "task_parser",
  system_prompt = "Return a JSON list of subtasks from the user's goal."
)

complete(model = "gpt-4-turbo", prompt = "Make a to-do list for building a website",
         functions = list(list(
           name = "make_tasks",
           parameters = list(
             type = "object",
             properties = list(tasks = list(type = "array", items = list(type = "string")))
           )
         ))
)

You can then parse the JSON and dynamically spawn new agents per subtask — that’s your intro to multi-agent orchestration.

If you’d like, I can draft a teaching vignette or mini-lab (e.g., “Multi-Agent R: A Newsroom of LLMs”) where students build a reporter–fact-checker–editor pipeline. Would you like me to sketch that out next?

Perfect — that tibble-as-graph idea is the sweet spot between conceptual clarity and R-native elegance. You don’t need LangChain’s object overhead; you just need a simple from–to table that defines who talks to whom.

Let’s riff on a few architectural patterns you can build just from that idea — all using the same tibble structure.


---

🧩 0. Baseline: Linear Chain

Each agent passes its output to the next — your “sequential pipeline.”

graph_chain = tibble::tribble(
  ~from,       ~to,
  "planner",   "researcher",
  "researcher","writer"
)

Flow: planner → researcher → writer
Useful for: summarization pipelines, analysis → writing → polishing, etc.


---

🔁 1. Hub-and-Spoke (Coordinator pattern)

One “central” agent dispatches to specialists and integrates their results.

graph_hub = tibble::tribble(
  ~from,       ~to,
  "coordinator","analyst",
  "coordinator","designer",
  "coordinator","writer",
  "analyst",   "coordinator",
  "designer",  "coordinator",
  "writer",    "coordinator"
)

Flow:
coordinator delegates → agents work → send back → coordinator merges.

💡 Great for teaching multi-role collaboration: e.g. Project Manager ↔ Subteams.


---

🔀 2. Branching Decision Tree

An agent dynamically routes to others based on task type or topic.

graph_branch = tibble::tribble(
  ~from,     ~to,
  "router",  "finance_agent",
  "router",  "health_agent",
  "router",  "education_agent",
  "finance_agent",  "summarizer",
  "health_agent",   "summarizer",
  "education_agent","summarizer"
)

Flow:
Router interprets user request → sends to one branch → then joins back at summarizer.

🧠 Shows students conditional routing: the “router” agent decides which path to activate.


---

🔄 3. Feedback Loop (Reviewer/Editor)

A pair of agents critique each other until a quality threshold is met.

graph_loop = tibble::tribble(
  ~from,      ~to,
  "writer",   "reviewer",
  "reviewer", "writer"
)

You can run this with a simple iteration cap:

for (i in seq_len(3)) results = run_graph(graph_loop, agents, "writer", input)

🔥 Demonstrates “refinement” — cyclical improvement.


---

🧱 4. Parallel Experts → Aggregator

Multiple agents process the same input, then merge results downstream.

graph_parallel = tibble::tribble(
  ~from,    ~to,
  "user",   "data_expert",
  "user",   "policy_expert",
  "user",   "ethics_expert",
  "data_expert",   "synthesizer",
  "policy_expert", "synthesizer",
  "ethics_expert", "synthesizer"
)

Flow:
User prompt fans out → parallel experts respond → synthesizer consolidates.

🌐 Good for teaching ensemble-style reasoning and multi-perspective synthesis.


---

🪄 5. Cascade with Evaluation Gate

A chain, but with a checkpoint agent that decides whether to continue.

graph_cascade = tibble::tribble(
  ~from,      ~to,
  "analyst",  "evaluator",
  "evaluator","reviser",
  "evaluator","finalizer"
)

Here, the evaluator uses function calling or structured output to decide:

"reviser" if work needs improvement

"finalizer" if it’s good enough


✅ Excellent for introducing control flow + quality assurance.


---

⚙️ 6. Multi-Team System (Modular subgraphs)

Compose smaller graphs into clusters and link them.

graph_teams = tibble::tribble(
  ~from,         ~to,
  "planner",     "team_research",
  "team_research","research_writer",
  "team_research","research_analyst",
  "research_writer","editor",
  "research_analyst","editor"
)

Idea: each “team” node could itself spawn its own internal subgraph (recursively defined).
That’s how you teach hierarchical orchestration.


---

🔗 7. Consensus System (Voting)

Each agent outputs an answer; a final arbiter compares and decides.

graph_vote = tibble::tribble(
  ~from,      ~to,
  "agent_a",  "arbiter",
  "agent_b",  "arbiter",
  "agent_c",  "arbiter"
)

The arbiter can request structured input like:

list(agent = "agent_a", answer = "…")

and produce a consensus or confidence-weighted summary.

🧮 Demonstrates evaluation, comparison, and meta-reasoning.


---

🧭 8. Dynamic Expansion (Self-organizing)

You can let an “orchestrator” edit the tibble dynamically — add new rows (agents/edges) mid-run.

# Add a new specialist dynamically
graph <- rbind(graph, tibble(from = "orchestrator", to = "new_specialist"))

This becomes the stepping stone to emergent graphs, where agents spawn others — exactly what LangGraph does, but simpler.


---

🧱 Teaching Framing

You can explain to students that:

The tibble is the "wiring diagram" of communication.

Each row is a message path.

run_graph() just interprets that wiring.


They can sketch it on paper before coding — it’s intuitive, visual, and entirely R-native.


---

Would you like me to extend your earlier run_graph() function to support one of these (say, the parallel experts → aggregator pattern), including how to collect and merge multiple inputs to a downstream agent?
